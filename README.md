# Some-PPT-templates-of-mine
I just write some PPT templates, which are used PowerPoint and Beamer. Including Chinese and English parts.
 ## Chinese
    It is modified by my Master degree interim report.

 ## English
    I superficially modify my roommate's report which is talked in a conference held by Russia. It is a revision of my chinese template.
 ## Beamer
    A beamer template modified from Thinghua beamer. Thank to Dr.WangYang, I get this template from his beamer published in his gitbuh.
