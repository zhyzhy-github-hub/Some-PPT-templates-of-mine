# Some-PPT-templates-of-mine
I just write some PPT templates, which are used PowerPoint and Beamer. Including Chinese and English parts.
 ## Chinese
    It is modified by my Master degree interim report.

 ## English
    I superficially modify my roommate's report which is talked in a conference held by Russia. It is a revision of my chinese template.
 ## Beamer
    A beamer template modified from Thinghua beamer.  To see the original template, please click [https://www.latexstudio.net/archives/4051.html]<https://www.latexstudio.net/archives/4051.html>.
